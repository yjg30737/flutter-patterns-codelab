Why I Undertook This Course

This project was undertaken to directly apply the new Records and Pattern Matching features introduced in Dart 3.

• I aimed to improve the readability and maintainability of the overall code by handling complex JSON data more clearly and type-safely.
• I aimed to restructure the API and data flow designed in the backend into a structure that could be seamlessly connected to the UI within a Flutter application.
• In the Flutter development environment, which targets both mobile and web, I aimed to maximize cross-platform code consistency and reusability by applying the latest language features.
• It was also a learning journey to combine my server and backend experience (RESTful API design, database design and operation) with my frontend/Flutter experience to become a "frontend developer with a full-stack sensibility."

The code in this repository was written with these goals in mind, implementing a method for destructuring data using records and patterns in a Flutter app and maintaining concise UI rendering logic.

But, to be honest, I'm still not entirely sure why I'd use it. But like any framework, I feel like I'll learn as I go!
